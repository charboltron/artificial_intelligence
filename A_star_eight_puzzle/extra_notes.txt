The following is a slightly more human look-at-able Puzzle solver with some extra information not
included in the summary findings. I've included Best First With Memory results (but not the puzzle path)
merely as a curious juxtaposition to the poor performance of simple Best First Search. In all cases, a stack and
and explored list were able to solve using only h(n) greedily, which is pretty interesting. 

Puzzle 1: The Mother Lode (28 Inversions!)
A* with mhtn heuristic solved this leviathan after expanding an astounding 16660 puzzle configurations (nodes)
A* with misplaced tiles and my heuristic, after running for several hours, still couldn't find the solution, due to 
the increased slowdown for each expansion caused by exponential space complexity. Since I needed to store and update
my seen successors list (and sort it), I had to terminate the process. I think if I had used a better data structure like
a priority queue (I used a list of tuples to keep track), it would have performed better.
